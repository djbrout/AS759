# AS759: Cosmology

**Boston University - Spring 2026**

This repository contains student projects for AS759 Cosmology.

## Projects

### Project 1: Two-Rung H0 Distance Ladder
Build a simplified Hubble constant measurement using Cepheid variables and Type Ia supernovae. Students will:
- Calibrate the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (Leavitt) Law using LMC data
- Measure distances to supernova host galaxies
- Construct a Hubble diagram and infer H0 using MCMC
- Understand correlated systematics and anchor marginalization

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas
- astropy, astroquery
- emcee, corner

## Instructor
Professor Dillon Brout
