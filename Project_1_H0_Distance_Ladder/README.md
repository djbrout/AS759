# Project 1: Two-Rung H0 Distance Ladder

In this project, you will measure the Hubble constant (H0) using a simplified two-rung distance ladder:

1. **Rung 1 (Anchor)**: Use Cepheid variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) with known geometric distance to calibrate the Period-Luminosity relation
2. **Rung 2 (Hubble Flow)**: Apply this calibration to measure distances to Type Ia supernova host galaxies and construct a Hubble diagram

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (Leavitt) Law
- Apply photometric calibrations and extinction corrections
- Query astronomical databases (SIMBAD) for redshift data
- Construct and fit a Hubble diagram using MCMC
- Understand correlated vs. uncorrelated systematic uncertainties
- Implement anchor marginalization for proper error propagation
